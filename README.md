# What is Zorro

Zorro is a cross-chain protocol designed to seamlessly move users' deposits back and forth across chains and automating swaps, bridging, compounding and deposits in LP pools on AMMs.

Unlike bridges, Zorro automates the full process end-to-end with just one click so you can invest on any AMM without worrying about cumbersome steps. Take advantage of Zorro's characteristics:

**USDC in, USDC out**\
You deposit USDC from any chain and when you withdraw you receive USDC back. This way you are not exposed to tokens' price changes while moving across chains and deciding where to invest next.

**Regulation safe**\
By depositing and withdrawing USDC you are also not exposed to latest regulations that are looking to classify many tokens as securities since USDC as a stablecoin is excluded from this classification

**Automated swaps, bridging, auto-compounding**\
Zorro automates everything from the moment you click "deposit" until the funds are deposited in the LP pools. Since Zorro can aggregate various steps into fewer blockchain transactions and across users, you safe gas fees versus doing it on your own

**Cross-chain**\
Zorro is cross-chain not multi-chain. This is a very important distinction. You do not need to switch chains in your wallet or worry where you hold your tokens. Simply choose a vault and Zorro deposits independently of what chain your funds come from or which chain the vault is on

**Gasless**\
Moving across chains usually means having to hold the native token on each chain to pay for gas but Zorro manages paying for gas via the ERC-20 permit signature function (Zorro charges for the gas through its fees but you don't need to worry about holding anything other than USDC)

**Decentralized**\
No need to sign up or login and full control over your funds; Zorro uses trustless contracts, oracles and bridges that can be fully tracked on chain
